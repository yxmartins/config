Here you will find my settings for Mutt, a text-based terminal-based mail client. 

* I use Mutt to connect my GMX account. 
* I tried to maintain my configuration simpler.
* My colorscheme is a modification of Dracula's.

## Installing

You can install Mutt directly from the package repository. For example, try

```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt-get install mutt
```
for Ubuntu/Debian based distros, and similarly for other distros. Then type

```
mutt -v
```

to confirm the installation and to see the version that was installed. If you use an older
distribution, probably the version will not be updated. In this case, to get the latest
version you can install from some ppa or build and install directly from the source.

For example, to install from [https://launchpad.net/~hloeung/+archive/ubuntu/mutt](this) ppa, just type

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hloeung/mutt
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install mutt
```

There are many pages and posts that may help in the installation and configuration. See,
for example, ...
